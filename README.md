# Optimal-Saving-and-Work-hours-in-the-Neoclassical-Growth-Model-with-Uninsurable-Individual-Risk

This paper introduces work - leisure choice into a constrained optimal policy problem in a 
neoclassical growth model with idiosyncratic risk and incomplete markets. The constrained 
planner cannot complete markets, but must improve welfare subject to agents' budget constraints.
As such, rather than addressing the market failure of incomplete markets, the planner addresses 
the pecuniary externalities of each agents' saving and work decision on interest and wage rates. 
In an economy calibrated to U.S. wealth and income inequality, the paper finds the constrained planner
increases aggregate capital and reduces aggregate hours worked. However, owing to a combination 
of price and wealth effects, in a constrained efficient allocation, only highly productive individuals
increase saving, while less productive individuals reduce saving. Moreover, only the asset poor and 
unproductive agents reduce work hours, while the wealthy and highly productive increase work hours 
and reduce leisure time.
